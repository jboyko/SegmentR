\usage{
load_segmentation_results(
  path,
  json_path = NULL,
  pattern = "\\\\.(jpg|jpeg|png)$",
  recursive = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string. Path to original image file or directory containing images.}

\item{json_path}{Character string. Optional path to JSON file or directory. If NULL,
will look in "json" subdirectory of image path.}

\item{pattern}{Character string. File pattern to match when path is a directory (default: "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png)$").}

\item{recursive}{Boolean. Whether to search for images recursively in subdirectories (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
For single files: A list containing the original image, segmentation results, and masks.
For directories: A list of results for each image plus summary information.
}
\description{
This function loads the original image(s), JSON results, and corresponding masks
from previous segmentation operations. It can handle both single files and directories.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load single image results
results <- load_segmentation_results(
  path = "path/to/image.jpg",
  json_path = "path/to/results.json"
)

# Load all results from a directory
results <- load_segmentation_results(
  path = "path/to/image/directory",
  recursive = TRUE
)
}
